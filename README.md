The script written in this analysis was to determine the election results for the data given to us for the Colorado congressional election. However, by a few modifications of the code it can be re-used to determine county turnout and winning canditate for any congressional election. The way to alter the script is by downloading the raw election data for another state into the resources folder and changing the file name on the code. As long as the raw data is formulated in the same rows and columns, this code should be able to run for any state election. However, if the data given to us is not in the same format, the modification will also be requied on line 49 and 53 to change the row numbers based on the raw data.
